# Next.js Secure Cloud Access Management System with Auth Login

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project with a secure cloud access management system, featuring user authentication and login functionality. It provides role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for different user roles and ensures secure session management.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality integrated into the application.
- **Cloud Access Management**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and permissions for different user roles.
- **Secure Session Management**: Utilizes tokens or cookies for session persistence.
- **Next.js API Routes**: Custom backend API routes for handling authentication and user management.
